# Project_Style_Transfer
Implementation of Neural Style Transfer in Tensorflow

This app takes a 'content' image and adapts it with texture elements from a second image. It is coded in Tensorflow / Python 
based on techniques from DeepLearning.ai specialization on Coursera and the Tensorflow / Keras documentation.
