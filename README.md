# Project_Style_Transfer
Implementation of Neural Style Transfer in Tensorflow

This app takes a 'content' image and adapts it with texture elements from a second image.

- Try my web app implementation at www.communicatemission.com/ml-projects#style_transfer.

The image model has been coded utilizing techniques from DeepLearning.ai specialization on Coursera (www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) and the Tensorflow style transfer documentation (www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer), which are in turn based on a paper by Gatys, Ecker and Bethge (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). The web app is built on the Anvil platform.
